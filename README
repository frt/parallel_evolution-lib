Parallel Evolution Library

Library to ease the implementation of evolutionary algorithms
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation] that use MPI
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface] for its
parallelization [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing].

Multiple different evolutionary algorithms can run in parallel and exchange
candidate solutions with each other.
